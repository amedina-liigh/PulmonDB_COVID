### Variants of UK Biobank

The authors perfomed  genome-wide association study (GWAS) of data for 1778 infected cases (445 deaths, 25.03%) distributed by the UK Biobank.

### Review of COVID-19: susceptibility

The authors summarized the knoledge about susceptibility factors to COVID-19. Published on 25th August, 2021

### Italian and Spanish GWAS

A meta-analysis of GWAS studies with 1610 patients and 2250 control participants from Italy (patients = 835, controls = 1255) and Spain (patients = 775, controls = 950)were included in the final analysis.

### GenOMIC GWAS from UK

Using data from GenOMICC (Genetics Of Mortality In Critical Care), the authors studied 2,244 GWAS from critically ill patients with COVID-19 from 208 UK intensive care units.

### Exploration of all ACE2 SNPs

With a total of 16,860 SNPS located within ACE2, the study was limited into SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.001: therefore 318 SNPs were used (308 intronic, 4 up-stream transcript variants, 2 synonymous, and 4 missense).
