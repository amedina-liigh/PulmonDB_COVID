### Variants of UK Biobank

The authors perfomed  genome-wide association study (GWAS) of data for 1778 infected cases (445 deaths, 25.03%) distributed by the UK Biobank.

### Exploration of all ACE2 SNPs

With a total of 16,860 SNPS located within ACE2, the study was limited into SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.001: therefore 318 SNPs were used (308 intronic, 4 up-stream transcript variants, 2 synonymous, and 4 missense).
